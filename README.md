## Aim of the Project 

This project was built to create a voice assistant, which interacts with you to perform basic tasks based on the commands you give.

## About *Galena*

Galena is your personal voice assistant, which is capable of understanding your commands through speech and interacting with you through speech. 

When a user gives a command, Galena knows what to do by recognizing the appropriate key words used by the user. 

## Prerequisites for Using Galena

### 1. A Stable Internet Connection:
Among the different tasks it can perform, Galena uses speech recognition and your browser for various tasks it needs to perform, which requires a stable internet connection. Lack of fast and stable internet deteriorates performance and may lead to malfunctioning. 

### 2. In-built Microphone or Sound Recognition:
Galena needs to hear your voice in order to function which requires your system to have an in-built microphone or sound recognition system. Note that the index number for speech detection through the microphone may need to be changed in the code for your system.

### 3. Libraries to be installed and/or imported:
The following Python libraries must be installed and/or imported:

#### 3.1. *speech_recognition*

#### 3.2. *pyaudio*

#### 3.3. *pyttsx3*
